## Overview

**zthoffman.com** is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my projects, skills, and experiments in interactive web design. The site is built as a dynamic desktop-like experience featuring draggable windows, interactive project cards (inspired by Pokémon cards), a playable Minesweeper game, and a PDF-based resume viewer.

## Features

- **Dynamic Window System:**
  - Draggable, minimizable, and resizable windows for navigating through the site.
  - Multiple "desktop" windows including links, project cards, and a resume viewer.
- **Interactive Project Cards:**
  - Each card includes a front (showcasing project visuals) and a back (with additional details and a link to the corresponding GitHub repository).
  - Projects include a Chess Robot, AI Racing Simulation, and more.
- **Customizable Themes & Music:**
  - Switch between color themes and background music tracks.
  - Integrated with a “jukebox” that supports multiple genres (Acoustic, Classical, Jazz, Lofi, Synthwave).
- **Minesweeper Game:**
  - A built-in, interactive Minesweeper game window for extra fun.
- **Resume Viewer:**
  - Displays a PDF version of my resume with controls for zoom and download.
- **Responsive & Interactive Design:**
  - Uses subtle animations, particle effects (via tsparticles), and a responsive layout for all screen sizes.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** Core technologies for structure, styling, and interactivity.
- **Libraries & APIs:**
  - [tsparticles](https://particles.js.org/) for particle effects.
  - PDF.js for rendering the PDF resume.
  - PIXI.js and pixi-filters for visual effects.
